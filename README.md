# README

Pamelas-Project is a fullstack website that works as an "wordpress" admin panel for a fictitious school.

Admin/User is able to create, view, edit, and delete students, cohorts, instructors, and courses.
Admin/User may also add instructors/students to a cohort, and cohort to a course.

The app is made in a way, where a Admin/User can easily keep track of which student is inside a cohort by going inside the cohort's page then clicking on the named link to bring up all students attending the cohort.


For now, there is no limitation for users. All users are created as admin.
Post MVP, have 3 different usertypes and limitation according to the user type.
